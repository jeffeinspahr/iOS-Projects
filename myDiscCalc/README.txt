The program is fully functional, and starts with example set of values to show the user proper format of input.  When the user hits calculate, it shows the original and discounted price.  When the user swipes, it shows 2 bar graphs, the first being the total price, the second being the discounted price in green and the discount amount in blue.  When the user swipes back, the values inputted are exactly where they left them.

There are no bugs that I have ran into thus far.
